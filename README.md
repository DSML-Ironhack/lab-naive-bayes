# Lab | Naïve Bayes


## Introduction

In this lab, you will use Naive Bayes to predict the presence of diabetes based on patient health metrics. By working with structured medical data, they’ll learn how Naive Bayes applies probability calculations to classify instances, understand its assumptions, and interpret model predictions through metrics and log probabilities.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `src` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of the Naïve Bayes Algorithm as well as the concept of log-probabilities in the decision making process in classification problems. 

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
